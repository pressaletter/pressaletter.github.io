        With this animation I tried to further explore the letters in motion in relation to space. The alphabetic system I created by coding - which originally maps and evolves according to the movement of the mouse on the X and Y axis - can be applied to other
        types of inputs, such as sounds, voices or waves. I was interested in creating an independent movement which emphasises how the letter evolves in the grid. After a few experimentations I decided to use sin-waves and cos-waves as input to trigger
        the letterâ€™s movement. These regular waves animating the layered letters create an abstract dance of gray shades - where I, 0, and U seem to breath asynchronously, folding and unfolding in space. This is entirely developed with coding, using javascript
        in the P5.js framework.
